    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The Petfinder Foundation supports the shelters and rescue groups that post their adoptable pets on Petfinder.com. Our mission is to prevent the euthanasia of adoptable pets. A nonprofit 501(c)3 public charity, we help organizations throughout North America increase adoptions, respond to and recover from disaster, and become more sustainable. The Petfinder Foundation provides cash and product grants so that homeless pets can be physically and mentally healthy and, ultimately, find loving forever homes.</p>
